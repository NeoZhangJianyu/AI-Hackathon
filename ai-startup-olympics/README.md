<h1>AI Startup Olympics Hackathon</h1>

# What's this Hackathon About?
The AI Startup Olympics is a 3-day event dedicated to accelerating the implementation of Intel’s accelerated software and hardware in industry-leading solution architectures. The Hackathon challenge consists of building an ML application according to specifications defined in the “Solution Blueprint.” This blueprint outlines the architectural components that your team must build to support your solution. The blueprint provides enough flexibility for teams to build to choose the data and AI problem they want to solve – which means you can bring your data and code to the hackathon. Teams will be judged on their ability to build according to these specs, solution innovation, and workload optimization.
