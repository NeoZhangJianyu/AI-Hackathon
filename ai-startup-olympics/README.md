<h1>AI Startup Olympics Hackathon</h1>

# What's this Hackathon About?
The AI Startup Olympics is a 3-day event dedicated to accelerating the implementation of Intel’s accelerated software and hardware in industry-leading solution architectures. The Hackathon challenge consists of building an ML application according to specifications defined in the “Solution Blueprint.” This blueprint outlines the architectural components that your team must build to support your solution. The blueprint provides enough flexibility for teams to build to choose the data and AI problem they want to solve – which means you can bring your data and code to the hackathon. Teams will be judged on their ability to build according to these specs, solution innovation, and workload optimization. 

# What if you don’t have code or data to bring? 
For teams that don’t have their own code and data to bring to the event, Intel will provide a set of sample solutions with data and code that participants can use as an alternative starting point.  

# Alternative Hackathon Solutions and Datasets
- [Drone Landing Areas (Computer Vision)](github.com/oneapi-src/drone-navigation-inspection)
- [Medical Imaging Diagnostics (Computer Vision)](github.com/oneapi-src/medical-imaging-diagnostics)
- [Customer Chatbot (Natural Language Processing)](github.com/oneapi-src/customer-chatbot)
- [Disease Prediction (Natural Language Processing)](github.com/oneapi-src/disease-prediction)

# Blueprint Description
Build an ML application based on the provided microservice architecture pattern. The design pattern splits data, training, and inference components into individual microservices.
