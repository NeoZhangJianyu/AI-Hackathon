# Welcome to the Machine Learning Track! ðŸš€

In this track of the hackathon, you will find the sample notebook that was used in the machine learning track of the AI Hackathon at Intel Innovation 2022. This notebook explores Intel's [Predictive Asset Analytics AI Reference Kit](https://github.com/oneapi-src/predictive-asset-health-analytics) and optimization techniques for model training, hyperparameter tuning, and inference. 

## Instructions
The dataset used in this notebook can be generated using the bash script provided in the Predictive Asset Analytics repository. For instructions on how to do this, please refer to a detailed overview [here](https://github.com/oneapi-src/predictive-asset-health-analytics#run-the-code-for-test-dataset-generation-training-the-model-and-prediction). Alternatively, you may substitute the dataset with your own tabular/structured data.

For system prerequisites, please see the `requirements.txt` file.
