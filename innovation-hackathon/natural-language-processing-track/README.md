# Welcome to the Natural Language Processing Track! ðŸš€

Author: Benjamin Consolvo, AI Solutions Engineer Manager at Intel

In this track of the hackathon, you will find two sample notebooks that were used in the NLP track of the AI Hackathon at Intel Innovation 2022. This notebook explores a binary classification humor dataset and optimization techniques for model training, hyperparameter tuning, and inference. 

## Getting Started

### Installation
There is a [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) file with all of the required Python packages present.

### Dataset
I do not provide the data in this repository. The data can be downloaded from [Kaggle here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/deepcontractor/200k-short-texts-for-humor-detection).

### Video Demo
