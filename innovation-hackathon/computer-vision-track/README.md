# Welcome to the Computer Vision Track! ðŸš€

In this notebook, we'll introduce the <b>[Visual Quality Inspection AI Reference Kit](https://github.com/oneapi-src/visual-quality-inspection)</b> and show you how to use Intel-optimized libraries for machine learning so you can win the Hackathon! The reference kit GitHub page provides a link to various datasets that all revolve around the concept of visually inspecting damaged products in the manufacturing process. In the future, you could play around with toothbrush, tiles, wood, etc. but in this notebook we will focus on pill quality. In this dataset, consumer over the counter medicial supplements are classfified into good or bad categories. Bad pills are ones that contain chips, cracks, or mishapen features.
